# Stock Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Steve was impressed with the first workbook that was created that allowed him to analyze an entire dataset in one push of a button. As a result, he wishes to do more research and and expand the dataset to include a larger dataset over the years. I have been tasked with editing, or refactoring the VBA code to loop through all the data one time to collect the same information at a much more proficient speed. I will then determine if refactoring the code successfully make the VBA script run faster. When refactoring the code, I will be making the code run more efficiently, with fewer steps, ;ess memory, and making it easier to read.
## Results
### 2017 and 2018 Stock Analysis: Comparison
When looking at the stock results from 2017 compared to 2018, we can see that 2017 had a much better return overall than 2018. In 2017, 11 out of the 12 stocks had a positive return, with DQ having a return as high as 199.4%. Meanwhile, when we take a look at the returns in 2018, only 2 out of the 12 had a positive return where the ENPH and RUN stock had a 81.9% return for ENPH and a 84.0% return for RUN. So overall, if you were to want to invest in a stock in 2018, you would have been better off buying in on RUN. In 2017, you would have still been getting a better return on ENPH with a 129.5% return. In conclusion, 2017 was a better year on returns than what 2018 produced.
